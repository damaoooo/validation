## 📋 Legend

- **Exist?**: Whether the vulnerable code actually exists in the repository
- **Invoked**: Whether the vulnerable functionality is actively called/used
- **Mentioned**: Whether the vulnerability is referenced in documentation or comments

## 🔍 Methodology

This analysis involved:
1. 🤖 **Automated Scanning**: Using Syft and Trivy vulnerability scanners
2. 🔍 **Manual Verification**: Code review to confirm actual vulnerability presence
3. 📊 **Impact Assessment**: Determining if vulnerable code paths are reachable
4. ✅ **False Positive Filtering**: Eliminating non-exploitable vulnerabilities

## 💡 Recommendations

- 🔄 **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- 🎯 **Contextual Analysis**: Always verify automated scan results manually
- 🛡️ **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls
- 📈 **Continuous Monitoring**: Set up automated dependency vulnerability tracking
